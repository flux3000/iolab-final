Notes for backend
1. Mailed nuforc.org to get data
2. was denied
3. wrote crawler to get all the ~100.000 entries they show on their website
4. format the date so it is searchable
5. output sigtings by year / month as json to client
6. output map data grouped by state as json to client
7. upload backend to my server and set http header so API gets available to everyone
